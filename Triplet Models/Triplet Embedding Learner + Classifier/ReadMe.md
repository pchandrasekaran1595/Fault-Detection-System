- Uses a Triplet of Inputs (Anchor, Positive, Negative) to learn new embeddings from the extracted features.

- Classifier (Similarity Score Predictor) takes the learned embeddings (from the embedding net in the previous step) and classifies it.

- GUI version has not been developed.

TEST : Create Dataset that uses all the Positive Directory Base Images as Anchors
